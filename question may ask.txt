question may ask

Perfect! Here’s a quick cheat sheet of what to expect next after submitting a Kubernetes + Docker full-stack assignment like yours:

1. Code Walkthrough / Technical Questions

They may ask you to explain your project step by step:

Architecture: How the frontend, issuance service, and verification service communicate.

Docker: Why you dockerized each service, Dockerfile details, and how images are built.

Kubernetes: Deployment manifests, namespaces, services (ClusterIP vs NodePort), and why Kubernetes is used instead of just Docker Compose.

Inter-service dependencies: How verification depends on issuance, any error handling.

Environment variables / configs: How you manage configuration between environments.

2. Problem-solving / Bug Fixing

Expect small “what if” questions like:

“If a pod crashes, how would you debug it?”

“How to scale the service if there are 1000 requests per second?”

“What if your frontend cannot reach the backend?”

3. Testing / Code Quality

Even though you didn’t submit tests, they may ask:

“How would you write unit or integration tests for your services?”

“How would you test Kubernetes deployments locally?”

4. Deployment / CI-CD

They may ask:

“How would you deploy this to the cloud (AWS / GCP / Azure)?”

“What would change if you moved from local Kubernetes (kind/minikube) to cloud-managed K8s?”

5. Practical Questions

“Why use Kubernetes if Docker Compose works?”

“What challenges did you face deploying this project?”

“How does your project handle failures?”

6. Quick Tips for the Discussion

Be confident but concise—explain key points clearly.

Use real examples from your project: e.g., show how you tested pods running locally.

Be ready to demonstrate the project live if asked—they might want to see it running.

💡 Summary: You did the hard part: submission is complete with Docker + K8s, fully running. Now it’s all about confidently walking them through your design and decisions.

If you want, I can write a one-page “talking points” guide for you to use during a discussion or interview, so you don’t miss anything. It will be ready to copy-paste and review in 5 minutes.
